                        A right is a freedom that is protected, such as the right to free speech and religion. A responsibility is a duty or something you should do, such as recycling or doing your homework.
                        Human rights are important in the relationships that exist between individuals and the government that has power over them. The government exercises power over its people. However, human rights mean that this power is limited. States have to look after the basic needs of the people and protect some of their freedoms.
                        The importance of rights and responsibilities. ... Rights mean that the state has a duty to make these privileges available to us. While these rights and freedoms are part of our expectations as citizens in a democracy, we spend very little time talking about our obligations to the democracy.
                        Democracies grant many freedoms to their citizens including the freedom to dissent and criticize the government. Citizenship in a democracy requires participation, civility, and even patience. Democratic citizens recognize that they not only have rights, they have responsibilities.  China is geographically located in East Asia whose vast landscape encompasses grassland, desert, mountains, lakes, rivers and more than 14,000km of coastline. Capital Beijing mixes modern architecture with historic sites and Shanghai is the global financial center (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018). China was a developing country like others and they faced a lot of problems in the past and after the world war 2 the organized themselves and developed a country that is leading the economy of the world today (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018). You can analysis China from different perspectives and below we are going to use PESTLE analysis. 
                        Socially, China’s population is composed of 56 ethnic groups with Zhuang dominating others. Most of Chinese speak Mandarin and they are so protective to their language to the extent that they don’t use any other language in education. Chinese have different beliefs; Buddhist 18.2%, Christian 5.1%, Muslim 1.8%, folk religion 21.9%, Hindu < 0.1%, Jewish < 0.1%, other 0.7% (includes Daoist (Taoist)), unaffiliated 52.2% (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018). 
                        Since the late 1970s, China has moved from a closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a major global role. China have profited their fact of having big population which are making cost of labor to be cheap and the availability of wide market.  Measured on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2016 stood as the largest economy in the world, surpassing the US in 2014 for the first time in modern history. China became the world's largest exporter in 2010, and the largest trading nation in 2013. Still, China's per capita income is below the world average (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018).
                        Politically China is a socialist republic that is led by communist party. Since the WW2 china is free from other big instabilities which granted peace and trust in the country. They have opened their boards to the outside world mostly t0 the developing countries and reduced and removed some trade regulations and tariffs. Though there are some corruption issues, the government is intervening to control all sectors of economics and ensure the clarity and just of the governance (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018). 
                        China is historically known for the invention of papermaking, printing, the compass and the gunpowder and is currently known as the center of advanced technology in the world (Central Intelligence Agency , 2018). They have well organized and advanced industries that are leading in the world. They have invented use of machines and the success story is their production being supplied all over the world. They also have well developed infrastructures that are encouraging the performance of every sector in the country. Due to growing industries they are facing a problem of environmental pollution and they have developed laws and measures to control their effects. The desert was attacking Beijing and they planted trees around the place and now the place is free from those scandals.
